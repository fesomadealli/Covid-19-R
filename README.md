# Covid-19-R
Final Project on Introduction to R Programming for Data Science, being part of a course series by IBM Skills Network and available on Coursera. 

This file contains the final project on the Introduction to R Programming for Data Science course by IBM Skills Network and available on Coursera.  This project does not include data visualiazation exercises and ittle to no emphasis is placed on data wrangling. Rather, it focuses on the basic steps in R programming as relating to Data Science. The exercises in the notebook are constrained to a set of 10 tasks that tests basic knowledge of R programming relating to data science and as such, in-depth data analysis was not done. Submissions were done by uploading screenshots via the Coursera classroom portal for peer grading.

# Practice Analysis on Coursera COVID-19 Dataset
This file contains the final project on the **Introduction to R Programming for Data Science** course by IBM Skills Network and available on Coursera. The final project comes after a series of ungraded lab exercises that help practice skills relevant to R programming for Data Science.

## Brief Description
This project does not include data visualiazation exercises and ittle to no emphasis is placed on data wrangling. Rather, it focuses on the basic steps in R programming as relating to Data Science. The exercises in the notebook are constrained to a set of 10 tasks that tests basic knowledge of R programming relating to data science and as such, in-depth data analysis was not done.

Should a student, fail to scrape the required table successfully, the **TASK 4: Get a subset of the extracted data frame** phase of the project provides a way of him/her getting an already processed csv file to use for the remainder of the task. Although, failure to complete the earlier tasks might earn such student 0 pts on such tasks in his peer-graded assessment.

## Dataset
The dataset is also uploaded. Dataset was scraped off a Wikipedia page and contains information on the COVID-19 pandemic from 172 different countries and across 9 different columns. A local version of the webpage is also uploaded.

## Tasks 
- Webscraping in R
- Data Wrangling
- Regular Expression
- Vector Operations in R
- And few more R Programming concepts
